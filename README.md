In this repository, you will find a shell with some builtins (commands made by myself: cd, setenv,
unsetenv, env) and can also use the basic command like on a classic terminal (ls, cat, echo, pwd,...).
You can use 2 commands at the time with the separator '|' but not like 5 in a row.

I will do some improvement in this project when I find the time to do it (like finishing to implement
the separators: ';', '<', "<<", '>', ">>" and also add the fact to use several command in a row).
Enjoy ^^
